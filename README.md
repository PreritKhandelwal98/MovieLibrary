# MovieLibrary

## Live Demo: [Demo](https://movie-library-jade.vercel.app/)

This project uses React and Node.js. It features user authentication (Sign In/Sign Up), movie search via OMDB API, and list creation similar to YouTube playlists with public or private options.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## How to Run

Clone the Repository

```bash
https://github.com/PreritKhandelwal98/MovieLibrary.git
```

## Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root folder and copy-paste the content of `.env.sample`, then add the necessary credentials. This `.env` file is for both the frontend and backend.

## Backend Setup

• Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

• Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

• Start the server:
```bash
node index.js
```

## Frontend Setup

• Navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd client
```

• Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

• Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
```

This includes a new "Prerequisites" section that instructs users to ensure Node.js is installed on their computer before proceeding with the setup steps.
